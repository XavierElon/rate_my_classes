Rate My Classes Website (WIP)

This is a full-stack MERN application deployed on AWS. It can be found at www.ratemyclasses.io

The site allows users to add reviews for courses they took at their respective university. There is a builtin authentication method that verifies the users school email address before they can add courses or reviews to prevent spam. They can only post reviews for the university connected to their email.

The university database is populated from a CSV file that lists all of the unversities in the world and their respective email domain.
